Using the Observatory plugin for RocketMod you can report players that are hacking on your server. Once reported they show up in the list of reports on https://observatory.rocketmod.net/. After they have been reported, the trial begins.
Every player has the right to vote on the trial for either a ban or a release of the charges. The strength of their vote is based on a reputation system.
